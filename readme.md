# Graduation project in the course "Server Side Development - Aichnroni" NODEJS.

The project is the backend for managing expenses for a specific client.
Customers can be updated in the users collection, costitems can be added, and the poor thing is that there is a collection called computed - which is basically the design pattern  we use to calculate the total customer expenses according to a specific year and month.


There are currently two endpoints.

- Adding a new cost item to the system (post)

- Receive monthly details for a specific customer ID.


To run the project:
1. Install NODE on your computer.
2. After downloading the project to your personal computer - it is required to run in Terminal - npm i - to run all the models required for the project.
3. Then run the project using npm start.

To test the precoat you can use Postman or Curl if you have Linux.
